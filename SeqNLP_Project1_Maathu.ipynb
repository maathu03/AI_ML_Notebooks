    "Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.\n",

    "We willl use the imdb dataset to learn word embeddings as we train our dataset. This dataset contains 25,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled with sentiment (positive or negative). \n",

    "Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). For convenience, the words are indexed by their frequency in the dataset, meaning the for that has index 1 is the most frequent word. Use the first 20 words from each review to speed up training, using a max vocab size of 10,000.\n",

    "5. Report the Accuracy of the model. (5 points)  \n",

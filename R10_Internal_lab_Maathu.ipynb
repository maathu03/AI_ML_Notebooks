We apply it to translating\n","#short English sentences into short German sentences,\n","#character-by-character. Note that it is fairly unusual to\n","#do character-level machine translation, as word-level\n","#models are more common in this domain.\n","\n","#Here's a summary of our process:\n","\n","#1) Turn the sentences into 3 Numpy arrays, encoder_input_data, decoder_input_data, decoder_target_data:\n","#encoder_input_data is a 3D array of shape (num_pairs, max_english_sentence_length, num_english_characters) containing a one-hot vectorization of the English sentences.\n","#decoder_input_data is a 3D array of shape (num_pairs, max_german_sentence_length, num_french_characters) containg a one-hot vectorization of the german sentences.\n","#decoder_target_data is the same as decoder_input_data but offset by one timestep. decoder_target_data[:, t, :] will be the same as decoder_input_data[:, t + 1, :].\n","#2) Train a basic LSTM-based Seq2Seq model to predict decoder_target_data given encoder_input_data and decoder_input_data. Our model uses teacher forcing.\n","#3) Decode some sentences to check that the model is working (i.e. turn samples from encoder_input_data into corresponding samples from decoder_target_data).\n","#Because the training process and inference process (decoding sentences) are quite different, we use different models for both, albeit they all leverage the same inner layers.\n","\n","#This is our training model. It leverages three key features of Keras RNNs:\n","\n","#The return_state contructor argument, configuring a RNN layer to return a list where the first entry is the outputs and the next entries are the internal RNN states. This is used to recover the states of the encoder.\n","#The inital_state call argument, specifying the initial state(s) of a RNN. This is used to pass the encoder states to the decoder as initial states.\n","#The return_sequences constructor argument, configuring a RNN to return its full sequence of outputs (instead of just the last output, which the defaults behavior). This is used in the decoder.\n","\n","# Summary of the algorithm\n","#- We start with input sequences from a domain (e.g. English sentences)\n","#    and corresponding target sequences from another domain\n","#    (e.g. French sentences).\n","#- An encoder LSTM turns input sequences to 2 state vectors\n","#    (we keep the last LSTM state and discard the outputs).\n","#- A decoder LSTM is trained to turn the target sequences into\n","#    the same sequence but offset by one timestep in the future,\n","#    a training process called \"teacher forcing\" in this context.\n","#    It uses as initial state the state vectors from the encoder.\n","#    Effectively, the decoder learns to generate `targets[t+1...]`\n","#    given `targets[...t]`, conditioned on the input sequence.\n","#- In inference mode, when we want to decode unknown input sequences, we:\n","#    - Encode the input sequence into state vectors\n","#    - Start with a target sequence of size 1\n","#        (just the start-of-sequence character)\n","#    - Feed the state vectors and 1-char target sequence\n","#        to the decoder to produce predictions for the next character\n","#    - Sample the next character using these predictions\n","#        (we simply use argmax).\n","#    - Append the sampled character to the target sequence\n","#    - Repeat until we generate the end-of-sequence character or we\n","#        hit the character limit.\n","\n","# References\n","#- Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\n","#    https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215\n","#- Learning Phrase Representations using\n","#    RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation\n","#    https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078\n","\n","\n","from __future__ import print_function\n","\n","from keras.models import Model\n","from keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense\n","import numpy as np"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Using TensorFlow backend.\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vi3lZq3AO9dh","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"outputId":"40a682bc-6e83-494d-a4d8-37c46deb5b83","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1558254999985,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1876,"user":{"displayName":"sairam janakiraman","photoUrl":"","userId":"11677302178638953515"}}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(\"/content/drive/\")"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive/; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive/\", force_remount=True).\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6e_J6pagO-fz","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["project_path = \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/R10_18MAY_2019/Internal_lab_19MAY2019/\""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"4jRTxBQ9owHH","colab":{}},"source":["batch_size = 64  # Batch size for training.\n","epochs = 10  # Number of epochs to train for.\n","latent_dim = 256  # Latent dimensionality of the encoding space.\n","num_samples = 10000  # Number of samples to train on.\n","# Path to the data txt file on disk.\n","data_path = 'fra.txt'"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"0N1Q-zzUJtO0"},"source":["### Connect to google drive"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"SEtf-c5Fo7eF","colab":{}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive/')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"Mv0XAJSZJyOl"},"source":["### Give the path for the folder in which the dataset is present in google drive"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"fXQOArlSo8SX","colab":{}},"source":["project_path = \"\""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SoEhVDh3qfuj","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Change present working directory"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"g-plftRTqlgB","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import os\n","os.chdir(project_path)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"GkAdNgJrKDvK"},"source":["## Load the pickle file (`english-german-both.pkl`) into a variable with name `dataset`\n","Run the below code to load the .pkl file."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"a8fpd1Lxo8VH","colab":{}},"source":["import pickle\n","\n","with open(project_path + 'english-german-both.pkl', 'rb') as f:\n","  dataset = pickle.load(f)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"9pkL351SKaWb"},"source":["## Check the `dataset` variable at this step.
